### NOTICE FOR DEVELOPERS:
FurBot is running on VERY old code -- most likely no updates are going to be made to this repository any more.

If you are a developer and you are interested in working on a version 2 (from scratch!) and help shape the future of FurBot, please read:

FurBot has received almost no love and/or attention from me for a good while now. I'vejust been doing IRL work stuff to
get by and pay bills o my interest in programming etc. has kind of faded. This means that i kind of forgot a lot of
programming stuff.

If you have a lot of patience and are willing to build a bot with someone who's basically starting all over again, let me know.

You can find me in the FurBot Discord server or DM me directly. [Server Link](discord.gg/ccwfwmMEmC)
