## 4.1.0 (May 11th, 2017)

### Features
- Added `!boop` command for those exquisite nose booping moments!
- Added `!kiss` command. Sometimes you just want to smooch someone!
- Added `!ustats` command. Now you can see how many times you've been hugged, booped or fed!
- Added `!e9` command. This will search **e926** for safe for work images. It skips the NSFW check.
- Removed `!chat` command response for now. We'll see how patreon goes and if we need it back.
- Removed some old administrative features.

### Bug Fixes
- Changed `!drama [number]` to also include a popcorn emoji. Before this was only on random drama images.
- Fixed the bot being incapable of having more than 1 character for a prefix.

<a name="4.0.1" />
## 4.0.1 (May 9th, 2017)

### Technical Notes
- Changed all the lewd commands to check channel NSFW setting instead of `!setnsfw`. Thus `!setnsfw` has been removed.

<a name="3.7.3" />

<a name="3.7.0" />

<a name="3.6.0" />
## 3.6.0 (February 16th, 2017)

### Features
- Added blacklisting for the lewd commands. This is a major feature that will allow you to filter out nasty images you don't want to see. However if you're still curious you can click the link at the top of the embed to still visit the site's page with the image on there. (Did you know this was a feature all along? Clicking the tags you searched for?).

### Bug Fixes
- Updated `!chat` but now requires API key. Limited to 5000 calls per month so not sure how long it will last.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed tag limit to all lewd commands, maximum is now 6
